# Assault Atari Games With Deep Learning DQN and DDQN

This notebook focuses on implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Atari games, specifically leveraging a project framework for training models like Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The workflow begins with extracting project files and installing necessary dependencies, such as `gym[atari]` for simulating Atari environments and `autorom` for managing ROM licenses. Several scripts related to DRL are executed to train and evaluate models in the Atari environment. Libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` are prepared for data analysis and visualizations. Additionally, the notebook handles saving simulation results, including gameplay videos, in a compressed format. Google Drive integration is also set up to store or access project files efficiently. This setup provides a complete pipeline for exploring DRL in Atari games.
